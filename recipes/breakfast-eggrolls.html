    <h1>Breakfast Eggrolls</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients and Equipment</Em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggroll Wrappers</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Sausage</li>
        <li>Potatoes (Shredded Hash Browns)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil of your choice (Vegetable)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pan for cooking</li>
        <li>Clean board</li>
        <li>Big Bowl!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>We're going to take the word "egg" in egg rolls far too<br>
    seriously here. Its a delicious all in one (or two, or three)<br>
    breakfast roll!</p>
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop down the sausage. Smaller sausage mixes in better</li>
        <li>Get your sausage cooked in the pan. Maybe not<br>
            all the way because you're leaving it in there<br>
            with the eggs afterwards.</li>
        <li>Do you know how to cook your eggs? I sure<br>
        hope so, because I don't remember. I can tell<br>
        you that I recommend you scramble them for this</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are well prepared you'll want to<br>
        toss everything into that bowl</li>
        <li>Get those hash browns crispy! When your hash<br>
            browns are ready, toss them in the bowl too</li>
        <li>Mix up the ingredients a bit! Every egg roll should have<br>
            plenty of everything inside!</li>
        <li>Place egg rolls on the clean board and wrap up the mix<br>
        one after another in the wrappers.</li>
        <li>Clean out the pan and heat some oil at the bottom</li>
        <li>Once the oil is shimmering place the Egg rolls in and<br>
        let them fry. You'll want them browned all over!</li>
        <li>Once they're all done, you're good to go!</li>
    </ol>
