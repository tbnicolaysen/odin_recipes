    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>This is my lovely fiancee's recipe for Chicken Adobo. She has been kind enough<br>
    to let me use it for this assignment. I seriously recommend trying it out. It is<br>
    an absolute delight</p>
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your marinade and mix everything together. Let it marinate at least<br>
        an hour. Leave overnight for best flavor</li>
        <li>In a large skillet on medium-high heat, warm up the oil (neutral oil works best,<br>
        avoid olive oil) When its done, add the chicken to start it with a good sear.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the marinade and lower the heat to medium. Let it simmer until<br>
        the sauce is reduced and the chicken is completely cooked through</li>
    </ol>
