  <h1> Bacon & Rice </h1>
  <h2> Ingredients and Equipment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooked Rice</li>
    <li>Bacon</li>
    <li> Chunky Salsa or Fresh Vegetables</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <ul>
    <li>1 or 2 pans of your preference</li>
    <li>Your handy grease jar</li>
    <li>Tongs</li>
    <li>Spatula</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h2>The Plan</h2>
   <p> The Goal in this Recipe is to fry rice in the bacon fat, turning your leftover rice into a<br>rich
    savory bacon dish with the crunch of vegetables and bacon</p>
   <br>
   <h2>The Process</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Cook the rice yesterday. Conventional Wisdom says fried rice is best from day old rice</li>
    <li>Cook bacon in the pan of choice.</li>
    <li>Pour excess bacon fat into a jar NOT. THE. DRAIN.</li>
    <ul><li>If you're using fresh veggies place them in now to get a minute or two head start!</li></ul>
    <li>Cook the rice in the bacon pan (or another pan with the remaining bacon grease) for 3 minutes</li>
    <ul><li>If you're using salsa pour it in now and let it simmer for a minute</li></ul>
    <li>Serve!</li>
   </ol>

   <p>Doesn't that look good? Maybe that serving was a little too greasy.</p>
